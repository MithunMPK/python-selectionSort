# python-selectionSort
We go from left to right, and find MinValue or  MaxValue.
** In this example, we find Min Value. 
after the first iteration, the min value is found and is swapped with the first element. 
so, the very first element is " sorted" 
in the secon iteration, the second position gets "sorted"
so there is only 1 swap per iteration, and the number of positions being analyzed decreases .
